    Find the best-fitting plane to a 3D point cloud using RANSAC (In serial).
    Slower -- but uses less ram if that's a consideration

    This function applies the RANSAC algorithm to find the plane that best fits a set of 3D points,
    iterating over random samples of points to estimate the plane equation.

    Args:
        pts (numpy.ndarray): 3D point cloud as a `np.array (N, 3)` where each row is a point [x, y, z].
        thresh (int or float): Threshold distance (in meters) from the plane considered as inliers. Points within this distance
                        from the plane are considered inliers (default: 100).
        maxIteration (int): Maximum number of iterations for RANSAC (default: 1000).

    Returns:
        tuple:
            - equation (numpy.ndarray): Plane equation parameters [A, B, C, D] for the plane equation
              `Ax + By + Cz + D = 0` as a `np.array (1, 4)`.
            - inliers (numpy.ndarray): Indices of the points from `pts` that are considered inliers.
