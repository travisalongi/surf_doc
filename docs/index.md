# SURF: Seismicity Utilized for Reconstructing Faults

SURF is a python-language code for modeling fault surfaces in 3D using hypocentral locations


## üèÑ Overview
SURF is an algorithm to generate 3D fault models. This algorithm utilizes open-source, well known and documented packages, to generate fault models that require very few user input parameters.

## ‚ö° Features
- **Automated event clustering**: Uses network-based clustering to identify fault-related seismicity.
- **Surface merging**: Combines small, coplanar clusters to construct continuous fault surfaces.
- **SVR-based fitting**: Applies support vector regression to estimate fault geometries.
- **3D visualization**: Generates interactive visualizations of fault models.
